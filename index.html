                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <div class="content">
                    <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at California State University San Marcos, with concentrations in Game Development, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Data Collection. 
                        I am driven by a desire to continuously expand my programming, problem-solving, and leadership skills.</p>
                    <p>During high school, I played a pivotal role in FRC i4th Robotics as Co-Captain, CAD Lead, and Mentor. 
                        In this role, I led and mentored students aged 12-18 who were interested in STEM and robotics. 
                        My experience in robotics provided me with extensive knowledge in mechanical design, electrical systems, coding, and CAD, helping to foster a collaborative and innovative environment.</p>
                    <p>My passion for tech extends to various solo projects, where I have applied my skills in programming and development to create games like Flappy Bird and TicTacToe, as well as practical applications such as a comedian tracker and a rent distribution calculator.</p>
                    <p>With a solid foundation in programming languages including C++, C#, JavaScript, and more, I am excited to take on new challenges and contribute to impactful projects. Outside of tech, I enjoy basketball, video games, MMA, and meditation, which help me maintain balance and focus.</p>
