                <div class="content">
                    <p>I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science at California State University San Marcos, with concentrations in Game Development, Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Data Collection. 
                        I am driven by a desire to continuously expand my programming, problem-solving, and leadership skills.</p>
                    <p>During high school, I played a pivotal role in FRC i4th Robotics as Co-Captain, CAD Lead, and Mentor. 
                        In this role, I led and mentored students aged 12-18 who were interested in STEM and robotics. 
                        My experience in robotics provided me with extensive knowledge in mechanical design, electrical systems, coding, and CAD, helping to foster a collaborative and innovative environment.</p>
                    <p>My passion for tech extends to various solo projects, where I have applied my skills in programming and development to create games like Flappy Bird and TicTacToe, as well as practical applications such as a comedian tracker and a rent distribution calculator.</p>
                    <p>With a solid foundation in programming languages including C++, C#, JavaScript, and more, I am excited to take on new challenges and contribute to impactful projects. Outside of tech, I enjoy basketball, video games, MMA, and meditation, which help me maintain balance and focus.</p>

                        <strong>Bazar (Full Stack Development Intern) â€“ May 2024 to Present</strong><br>
                        During my internship at Bazar, I work on backend development and data scraping projects, gaining valuable hands-on experience. 
                        My key responsibilities included:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Debugging and optimizing backend code to improve application performance and reliability.</li>
                        <li>Developing and maintaining RESTful APIs to support dynamic data exchange between client applications and the server.</li>
                        <li>Designing and implementing efficient data scraping scripts to extract, clean, and process large datasets from multiple web sources.</li>
                        <li>Collaborating with cross-functional teams to integrate backend services with frontend applications seamlessly.</li>
                        <li>Documenting workflows and code changes to ensure clarity and maintainability for future developers.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        This role allowed me to deepen my understanding of backend technologies, including server-side scripting, database interactions, and web scraping tools. 
                        It also enhanced my problem-solving and debugging skills as I resolved complex issues in production code.
